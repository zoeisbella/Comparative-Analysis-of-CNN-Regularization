# Comparative-Analysis-of-CNN-Regularization
This project systematically compares the effects of various regularization techniques on CIFAR-10 image classification. Through eight distinct experimental configurations, it provides an in-depth analysis of how data augmentation, GroupNormalization, and Dropout—individually and in combination—impact the performance of a CNN model.
